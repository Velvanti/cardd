            <p class="message">Happy birthday Saiko, its your <em>REDACTED</em> birthday! I hope today at work wasn't too bad for you and that your coworkers enjoyed your cake.
            I wanted to create this virtual birthday card as I can't mail you a physical one and I wanted to try hosting a website. My apologies if the styling of the card
            isn't as good, I am not the best when it comes to these things but I hope you enjoy it. Enough rambling, I wanted to say that finding you was like a diamond in the rough
            a microcelebrity as some people on twitter might say. Between your youtube RP's that helped my insomnia at night or the streams that I play in the backround to feel less lonely,
            it truly has been quite a blessing to come across you. Although we are a small knit community it wouldn't be for you, you're hard work, you're dedication, your consideration of us as viewers. I really appreciate all the work you put in and not forgeting us or seeing us the view as wallets. The streams were always etertaining, you always answered everyones questions, and made my day every time you streamed. It breaks my heart that you never celebrated your birthday as I am in the same boat and can relate. I am glad that you have us at the viewers to appreciate your birthday, know you are not alone and that you have me along with your community who all love you. The most beautiful, pretty, adorable, funny, streamer we could have ever asked for. I hope you enjoy this card, I wanted to do more with animations but unfortunately there is a first for everything and this is my first time making a website and hosting it 3:.
